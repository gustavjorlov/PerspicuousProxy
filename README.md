# PrettyProxy
Buzzword driven proxy for monitoring requests visually while getting the opportunity to interfere with the activity in a fun way

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Run `npm start`

Now you are able to view the Pretty Proxy view in your browser at http://localhost:9999.
Use http://localhost:3000 as proxy when making requests from your application / server.

See the awesomeness!
